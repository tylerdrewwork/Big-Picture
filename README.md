## User Story
Finding a job can be extremely difficult, especially in our modern world.  We wanted to create a site that allowed the user to find jobs from the Adzuna website and then they were allowed to see through specific filters what the chart of these jobs looked like so they could better understand analytically what companies were looking for.

## Description:
Track jobs around the world and provide a graph with different descriptors that show you data based on the jobs you have searched for, as well as giving the user a motivational quote.

## Features
- Search bar with saving function of previous inputs
- Clean UI and front-page
- Filters for jobs such as: Title, Description, Company, country, State, City
- A random motivational quote to help the user feel encouraged

##### Noteworthy:
- Created with materialize style
- Custom graph charts with various color schemes
- Links to job URL'S that were given through Adzuna  API 
- Links chart with Adzuna to showcase the number of jobs that are posted

## Execution:
- Created a template to site using HTML and styled with CSS
- Linked the Adzuna API and then linked that to the chart script 
- Chart was then populated with job information from Adzuna API
- Linked Adzuna job listing sites to job listings card
- Added motivational quote API that was then added to the top of the page 
- Styled chart and job listings to make it more clean
